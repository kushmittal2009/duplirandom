## The DupliRandom java software

### The duplicRandom is kind of what it sounds like. It is a software where you enter some words that you want to duplicate and randomize their orders.

#### What do you do in it?

##### You can  

- enter phrases in the word boxes if you want the specific phrase to stay together when the things randomize.
- You can also enter only words in the words section which will make only duplicate and randomize the words.
- Whatever one you do there it will ask you for how many words you want in total. *Note that if you write phrases in the word section than the entire phrase would be counted as 1 word so make sure about that.
#### What you can use this on?

- You can use this for example if you want a long description of something and you just want to stuff things in. 
- You can also use this if you need it for randmized words that you need to make your kids identify.
- For other purposes it is also usable.

*Note that until next release do not put commas in the word boxes exept for when it asks you what to seprate it with.

#### Now lets come to the main point how do we run this?

#### To run this on whatever OS you are on install a java jdk or jre that is version 15 or higher. Then go into the directory where you downloaded the latest release from the release tab.
#### For download the two files duplirandom.bat and duplirandom.jar . Then double click on the batch file. It will run the jar file for you. If you do not download the jar file and you download only the bat file it will automatically download it for you.Or you can just download the jar file and run the command in cmd or powershell.

```
java -jar duplirandom.jar
```

#### For Linux open terminal and now you have two options.

Option 1, run this command by using the java -jar command.
```
java -jar duplirandom.jar
```
Option 2, run this command by doing ./duplirandom.jar

```
sudo apt-get install binfmt-support
```
then
```
chmod a+rx duplirandom.jar
```
lastly, to start with ./
```
./duplirandom.jar
```
#### For mac do the same thing you would on linux.

#### For all other OS open some kind of terminal there then run this command.

```
java -jar duplirandom.jar
```
