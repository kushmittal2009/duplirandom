## The DupliRandom java software

### The duplicRandom is kind of what it sounds like. It is a software where you enter some words that you want to duplicate and randomize their orders.

#### What do you do in it?

##### You can  

- enter phrases in the word boxes if you want the specific phrase to stay together when the things randomize.
- You can also enter only words in the words section which will make only duplicate and randomize the words.
- Whatever one you do there it will ask you for how many words you want in total. *Note that if you write phrases in the word section than the entire phrase would be counted as 1 word so make sure about that.
#### What you cna use this on?

- You can use this for example if you want a long description of something and you just want to stuff things in. 
- You can also use this if you need it for randmized words that you need to make your kids identify.
- Other ppurpsses are also usable.

#### Now lets come to the main point how do we run this?

#### To run this on whatever OS you are on install a java jdk or jre that is version 15 or higher. Then go into the directory where you downloaded the latest release from the release tab.
#### For windows open cmd there or a powershell window and input this command.

```
java -jar duplirandom.jar
```
#### For Linux open terminal and now you have two options.

1. run this command by using the java -jar command.
```
java -jar duplirandom.jar
```
2. run this command by doing ./duplirandom.jar

```
sudo apt-get install binfmt-support
```
